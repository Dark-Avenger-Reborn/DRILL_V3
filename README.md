# 🎯 DRILL: Advanced C2 Framework v3.0

**DRILL** (Distributable Remote Integrated Lightweight Link) is a powerful and stealthy Command and Control (C2) framework designed for seamless operation across various environments.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌐 WebSocket Communication
DRILL utilizes WebSocket protocol for C2 communications, effectively bypassing firewalls and proxies. This allows for real-time, bidirectional communication between the agent and the server, enhancing stealth and efficiency.

### 🔌 Single Port Operation
All traffic flows through a single port using HTTP/HTTPS, simplifying network traversal and making it easier to disguise as legitimate traffic.

### ☁️ Cloudflare Tunnel Compatibility
DRILL can be easily tunneled through Cloudflare, providing an additional layer of security and obfuscation for C2 communications.

### 🐳 Cross-Platform Payload Generation
Built-in Docker integration enables seamless payload creation for both Linux and macOS targets, expanding the framework's versatility.

### 🔒 Robust Persistence Mechanisms
- **Windows**: Implements startup registry keys and PowerShell profile modifications
- **Linux**: Creates a user-local systemd process for persistent access

### 📂 Advanced File Transfer Capabilities
- Send and receive files to/from single or multiple machines simultaneously
- Supports transfer of executable files, enhancing post-exploitation flexibility

### 🛠️ Post-Exploitation Modules (PEM)
- Credential theft tools for harvesting login information
- Mass command execution across multiple compromised systems
- Easily expandable module system for future enhancements

### 🎨 Redesigned User Interface
Version 3.0 features a completely overhauled UI, improving usability and efficiency for operators.

## 🏗️ Architecture

DRILL follows a typical C2 framework architecture:

1. **Agent**: Malware running on targeted systems, connecting back to the teamserver
2. **Teamserver**: Central backend service managing agent communications and operator interactions
3. **Client**: Web interface for operators to control the teamserver and issue commands

## 🔮 Upcoming Features

- Enhanced post-exploitation modules
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) mode:
  - Keyboard and mouse locking
  - Input mirroring from operator to target
  - Target screen viewing
  - Webcam access
